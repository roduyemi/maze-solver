This project solves simple mazes. The mazes are read in via an input file and the shortest path through the maze is output.

To Run in an IDE (Eclipse etc):

	Create new Java project and import Maze.java
	Create package maze
	Run as Java Application

Maze file format
================

The input is a maze description file in plain text.  
 1 - denotes walls
 0 - traversable passage way

INPUT:
<WIDTH> <HEIGHT><CR>
<START_X> <START_Y><CR>		(x,y) location of the start. (0,0) is upper left and (width-1,height-1) is lower right
<END_X> <END_Y><CR>		(x,y) location of the end
<HEIGHT> rows where each row has <WIDTH> {0,1} integers space delimited

OUTPUT:
 the maze with a path from start to end
 walls marked by '#', passages marked by ' ', path marked by 'X', start/end marked by 'S'/'E'

Example file:  
10 10
1 1
